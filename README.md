# PAN-Database-Application
A database web application built from scratch using Azure SQL Database, Java, JDBC, JSP and HTML for a DBMS Class project. Description of the database, requirements and queries along with frequencies are provided below -


### Overview

The Patient Assistance Network (PAN) is a non-profit organization that provides support and care for patients.  PAN needs to implementa database system to keep track of the personnel necessary to support the organization.  In this project, your task will be to design and implement this database system.  The information that needs to be stored in the database is described in the next section.

### System Requirements
There are many categories of people that need to be tracked in the PAN database.  Each person may fall into more than one of the following categories: clients, volunteers, employees, and donors.  PAN tracks the name, social security number, birth date, race, gender, and profession of each person. In addition, PAN stores the contact information for each person consisting of a mailing address,  email  address,  and  home,  work, and cell phone number. PAN  also  sends  a  monthly newsletter to people on its mailing list, so the database should indicate whether or not each person in the database is on that list. Finally, the system should have the ability to store a list of emergency contacts for the  people in the database. This information should  record  the  name  and  contact information  for  each  of  the  emergency  contacts  along  with their respective relationship to the person in the database.

PAN tracks its list of clients in the database. For each client, PAN tracks the name and phone number  of  his  or  her  doctor  and  attorney.    PAN also  tracks  the  date  the  client  was  first assigned to the organization.  Each client has a list of needs.  Examples of these needs include visiting, shopping, housekeeping, transportation, yard work, and food.Each of these needs is also associated with a value indicating its importance to the client (1-10).  PAN also tracks the list of insurance policies that each client has.  Each insurance policy has a unique policy id, a provider id, provider address, and a type such as life, health, home, or auto.

PAN provides care for each client using teams that contain many volunteers. Each team cares for several clients, and more than one team may care for a client. Each team is identified by its  name,  and  each  team  also  has  a  type  and  a date  it  was  formed. A  volunteer  may  serve  on multiple teams.  For each volunteer, the database should store the date he or she first joined PAN and the date and location of his or her most recent training course. In addition, PAN should record the number of hours a volunteer worked each month for a particular team.  Note that the volunteers do not work the same number of hours each month. One of the volunteers on a team serves as the team leader.  This information should be tracked in the database as well.  In addition, volunteers and clients may switch teams; so, the database system should provide the ability to mark whether or not each volunteer and client is active or inactive on a specific team.

Every team reports periodically  to  one  PAN  employee  to  discuss its current status, and more than one team may report to the same employee.  The database should record the date of each report as well as a description of its content. For each employee, the database should store the employee’s salary, marital status, and hire date. An employee may charge several expenses each month.  The database should track the date of the expense, along with the amount and its description.

PAN depends on support from its donors. The database shouldtrack these people as well as record each of their donations.  This information should include the date, amount, and type of donation  along  with  the  name  of  the  fund  raising  campaign  that  generated  the  donation  if  it  is applicable.  If the donation was made by check, the database should record the check number.  If the donation was made by credit card, the database should record the card number, card type, and expiration date.  In addition, each donor may wish to remain anonymous, so the database should record that information as well.

Each person in the database may be affiliated with an external organization.  The database should  track  this  information  as  well. Each  organization  should  have  a  unique  name,  mailing address, phone number, and contact person.  In addition, each organization may sponsor one or more PAN teams, and a team may have more than one sponsor.  If the organization is a business, the database should record the business type, size, and company web site.  If the organization is a  church,  the  database  should record  its  religious  affiliation. Each  organization may  also  make several donations to PAN, and the database should track the same donation information as it does for individual donors.  This includes the ability for the organizationto make anonymous donations.
